    "Another way to control the flow of code excustion is by using loops where a block of code is excuted multiple times. There two main types of loops in Python: \n",
    "1. `for` loop; where the block of code is excuted n times (a given number of iterations)\n",
    "2. `while` loop; where the block of code is excuted as long as some condition is true, when that condition evaluates to `False`, Python interpreter exits the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For loop\n",
    "They are usually used to iterate over sequence data types using a dummy variable. The general form is:\n",

In the first iteration, the variable `fruit` is assigned the value of the first element of the list `fruits` (`fruit = apple`). Inside the loop, the the value of the variable `fruit` is prented. Because this is the end of the loop block, the iteration ends and the next iteration begins by reassigning the variable `fruit` to the second value inside the list. This happens untill all values in the list are used for iterations and there are no more items. the Python interpreter exits the loop at this point. Let's try other types of sequence data types."
