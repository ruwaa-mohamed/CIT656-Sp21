    "### Installing Python\n",
    "Python is a programming Language that we use to communicate with computers. What does it mean to install Python? It's more of installing the \"dictionary\" that the computer uses to understand Python; the Python interpreter. Think of it as a human being learning German before travelling to Germany. </br>\n",
    "Python installation depends on the platform of the computer. Latest available Python version is 3.9.2. You can find it here >> https://www.python.org/downloads/\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Windows Users\n",
    "1. Visit the above link and download Python 3.9.2 for Windows, or download one of the following two files:\n",
    "    1. for 32-bit Windows: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.2/python-3.9.2.exe\n",
    "    2. for 64-bit Windows (Recommended): https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.2/python-3.9.2-amd64.exe\n",
    "2. Once the download is complete, double click on the installer file and follow the normal installation procedure. **Don't forget to check the checkbox of add to envirnoment PATH before clicking the Finish button!**\n",
    "3. To make sure that Python has been installed, open the `cmd` program or `PowerShell` program and type `python`. You should see `>>>` after the installed Python version details. Red lines means that either Python was not successfully installed, or it hasn't been added to the environment PATH variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Linux Users\n",
    "1. Open the terminal from the applications menu or by clinking on `CTRL+ALT+T` and run the following commands:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "sudo apt update\n",
    "sudo apt upgrade\n",
    "sudo apt install python3.9 python3-pip\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. To make sure that Pyhon has been installed, open the terminal and type `python3`. You should see `>>>` after the installed Python version details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to install Python:\n",
    "1. Visit the above link and download Python 3.9.2 for Windows, or download this file >> https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.2/Python-3.9.2.tar.xz\n",
    "2. Open the terminal from the applications menu or by clinking on `CTRL+ALT+T` and run the following commands:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd Downloads/\n",
    "tar -xvf Python-3.9.2.tar.xz\n",
    "cd Python-3.9.2/\n",
    "./configure\n",
    "make\n",
    "make test\n",
    "sudo make install\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. To make sure that Pyhon has been installed, open the terminal and type `python3`. You should see `>>>` after the installed Python version details.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### MacOS Users\n",
    "Using GUI:\n",
    "1. Visit the above link and download Python 3.9.2 for MacOS, or download this file >> https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.2/python-3.9.2-macosx10.9.pkg\n",
    "2. Double click on the downloaded file and follow the normal installation process. Don't forget to add it the environment PATH.\n",
