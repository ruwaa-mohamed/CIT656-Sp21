    "### Installing Python\n",
    "Python is a programming Language that we use to communicate with computers. What does it mean to install Python? It's more of installing the \"dictionary\" that the computer uses to understand Python; the Python interpreter. Think of it as a human being learning German before travelling to Germany. </br>\n",
